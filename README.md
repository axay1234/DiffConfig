# Config Diff Tool

The **Config Diff Tool** is a Python-based application designed to compare two configuration files (e.g., Cisco configuration files) and generate a detailed diff output. The tool uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter that allows users to browse for the configuration files and view the resulting diff.

## Features

- **Hierarchical Comparison:**  
  The tool builds a nested dictionary from the configuration files based on indentation levels. It then recursively compares these trees to highlight differences.
  
- **Detailed Diff Output:**  
  The diff output marks removed lines with a `-` and added lines with a `+`, including all child commands.
  
- **User-Friendly GUI:**  
  A simple Tkinter-based interface provides file browse dialogs for selecting the old and new configuration files.
  
- **Automatic Output File Naming:**  
  The diff result is saved as a text file with a name that includes the current date (e.g., `diffConfig_20250208.txt`) in the same folder as the script.

## Prerequisites

- **Python Version:**  
  The application requires **Python 3.6** or later.  
  (Note: f-strings, which are used in the code, were introduced in Python 3.6.)

- **Tkinter:**  
  Tkinter is used for the GUI. It is included by default with most Python installations. If you encounter issues, check your Python installation or refer to your operating systemâ€™s instructions for installing Tkinter.
